# rp-angular-poll
A small polling (survey) application that leverages Angular JS and Firebase Backend As A Service

* NPM - You can install this via your OS package manager (homebrew, apt, yum, rpm), even chocolatey
on MSW.

##Installation Steps:
Execute this command in the project root to download all dependencies:

```
    npm install

## Developing
Start a dev web server to serve the app

```

Use live reload so that HTML changes reflect on the browser automatically:
